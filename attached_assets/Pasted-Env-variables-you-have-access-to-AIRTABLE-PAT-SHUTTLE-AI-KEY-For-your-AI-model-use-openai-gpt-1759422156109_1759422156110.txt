Env variables you have access to:

AIRTABLE_PAT & SHUTTLE_AI_KEY

For your AI model, use "openai/gpt-5" with shuttleai.

Example request:

from shuttleai import ShuttleAI

shuttleai = ShuttleAI(api_key="$SHUTTLEAI_API_KEY", timeout=30)

response = shuttleai.chat.completions.create(
  model="openai/gpt-5",
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
  temperature=0.7,
  max_tokens=5
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

For the UI, make it a nice, light theme UI styled, icons. use tailwind. Make an account system.

The app in general should integrate well with airtable. Ask for a Base ID, table name and scan the table for feilds, and use ai to determine which one is the Code URL, playable URL, hackatime hours, AI Review Notes and AI User Feedback. If you determine these feilds arent there, create them!

Allow multiple bases and tables to be hooked up at the same time

Have ajobs tab which shows running review jobs and the task they are on

Step 1: Check if already submitted. Search unified for playable and code URL of the project you are reviewing. If there is a match in unified for any one of them, it means they already submitted.

Unified YSWS DB

Base ID: app3A5kJwYqxMLOgh
Table: Approved Projects
Feilds: Email, Playable URL, Code URL

--

Step 2, test project

Use Code URL feild from inputted record/submitted project and use AI to visit the website, test its features and conclude if it works and is legit or not. Make a web request, get the site content, detect buttons, go to them, submit more of the page content to the ai until its all done and then make a conclusion response. Like an agent

--

Step 3, Review committs

Check Code URL, should be github and check commits, run them through AI and determine if the hours and commits match up. If they dont, thats OK, they might just choose to commit all at once. But yeah in your review explanation say that they didnt commit too much.

--

Step 4, Finalize

Finish your auto review. Determine Flagged, Approved or Rejected. Have a review justification and IF NEEDED user feedback that will be sent to the user that submitted the project. Put that in the ai user feedback and ai review feild.
