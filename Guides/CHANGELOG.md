# Changelog - Hack Club Vision

## Version 2.0 - Database Persistence & Enhanced Review System (Latest)

### üéØ Major Changes

**Database-Persisted Jobs**
- Jobs now stored in SQLite database instead of in-memory
- All job history persists across server restarts
- Added `user_id`, `details`, and `completed_at` fields to ReviewJob model
- Users can now see all their historical job data
- Last 50 jobs displayed per user
- Location: `app.py:82-108`

- Clear user feedback when non-GitHub URL detected
- Location: `app.py:474-508`

### üîç Enhanced Review Process

**Significantly Improved Duplicate Detection**

- New scoring system: originality_score (1-10) and quality_score (1-10)
- Identifies red flags (copied templates, tutorials, placeholders)
- Strict criteria for legitimate vs copied projects
- Technical metadata included in results
- Location: `app.py:189-264`

**Comprehensive Commit Analysis**
- Analyzes up to 50 commits (up from 20)
- Fetches detailed stats for each commit (additions/deletions)
- Calculates time span of development
- Tracks multiple authors
- New metrics: commit_quality_score, code_volume_appropriate, estimated_actual_hours
- Detects suspicious patterns (bulk commits, generic messages, timing anomalies)
- Strict evaluation against claimed hours
- Identifies red flags automatically
- Location: `app.py:266-386`

**Stricter Final Decision Logic**
- Explicit automatic rejection criteria (10+ rules)
- Clear flagging criteria for manual review (8+ rules)
- Strict approval requirements (10 must-pass criteria)
- Confidence scoring (1-10)
- Detailed reasoning citing specific scores
- Lower approval threshold to ensure quality
- When in doubt, flags for human review
- Location: `app.py:388-442`

### üìä Review Criteria

**Automatic Rejection:**

- Originality score < 3
- No GitHub repo/commits

**Flag for Manual Review:**
- Hours mismatch > 5 hours
- Suspicious/bulk commit patterns
- Low commit quality (< 5/10)
- Marginal quality (4-6/10)
- Red flags detected
- Questionable originality (3-5/10)

**Approval Requirements (ALL must pass):**
- Not duplicate
- Project working and legitimate
- Quality score ‚â• 7/10
- Originality score ‚â• 6/10
- Commits match hours
- Consistent commit pattern
- Commit quality ‚â• 6/10
- Appropriate code volume
- No major red flags

### üîß Technical Improvements
